🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio** !
<br>
This repository is a collection of my cybersecurity projects, highlighting my skills in network security, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, threat analysis, malware analysis, and the development of secure systems and protocols. Each project includes code, tools, and detailed documentation to demonstrate methodologies, findings, and insights.

## 📑 Explanation
Each project has its own folder, which may include:
  - `src/` → Contains scripts, exploits, or automation tools used in the project
  - `notebooks` → Jupyter notebooks (if applicable) for analysis, simulations, or security testing results
  - `requirements.txt` → Project dependencies or tool requirements
  - `README.md` → Short description of the project
  - `Report` → Detailed documentation of methodology, analysis, and outcomes 
  - `Dashboard` → Some projects may include interactive dashboards for monitoring security metrics
- The root `README.md` (this file) gives an overview of all projects in the repository.
